I happened upon this [Harry Potter Hooded Towel
tutorial](https://www.raegunramblings.com/2016/07/diy-harry-potter-hooded-towels-tutorial.html) and
both got really excited (the kids love Harry Potter and so do I!) and felt kind of dumb (when they
were tiny I had all sorts of ideas for cool hooded towels and I never realized a hooded towel is
just a hand towel + a bath towel).

When I saw the tutorial I got some red towels for quidditch robes like in the tutorial and also some
black ones. But I did hit a small snag. They no longer make the cute Riley Blake chevron material
linked in the tutorial, and a search of Joann/Michael/fabric.com didn’t yield any striped or chevron
fabric in yellow/red at all! Luckily I found some red and white chevron fabric and soaked it in
yellow dye.

Then I followed the tutorial for the red hooded towels, and modified a bit for the black ones. I’m
really happy with the way they came out, and the kids love them!
