As kids we always made [milk carton gingerbread
houses](https://www.simplykinder.com/milk-carton-gingerbread-houses-how-to/), but I’ve always wanted
to try making a real one. I found this set of [gingerbread house cookie cutters with a recipe
book](https://www.worldmarket.com/product/mini+3-d+gingerbread+house+cookie+cutter.do) at Cost Plus
World Market and decided to give it a shot with the kids and their cousin. It took some planning
because we needed to bake the dough ahead of time, but overall it was well worth it–the gingerbread
pieces held up and stuck together really well, and the kids loved decorating them so much!
