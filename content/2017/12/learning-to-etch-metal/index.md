  **Warning**<br>
  Metal etching can be dangerous! If you're going to try this, make sure to read all red the warning
  text at the bottom of the [Edinburgh Etch
  page](http://www.nontoxicprint.com/etchcopperandbrass.htm) first!

When I took the laser cutter class at [Maker Works](https://www.maker-works.com/) and learned about
all the different materials you can etch, I was really interested in learning how to etch metal. But
most lasers at makerspaces and such are CO2 lasers, which can’t etch metal. You can
use [Cermark](https://www.johnsonplastics.com/engraving/engraving-supplies/cermark), but it just
makes the metal black where the laser hits.

I really wanted to do something that was etched into the metal. Getting a fiber laser was out of the
question, so I researched techniques for etching metal, and I learned about chemical etching. The
basics are this:

* You apply a resist to the metal. This should be something the etchant won’t get through. It can be
  sharpie pen, nail polish, vinyl stencils, electrical tape, lots of things. But I really wanted
  high detail etchings, and ones from photos, that I could design on the computer. After some
  digging, I found out about [blue press n peel paper](http://www.techniks.com/). You print out the
  resist onto the paper on a laser printer, and use heat to transfer it to the metal. I used this
  for all my etchings.
* You put the metal in a bath of etchant. Different metals will etch in different solutions; I
  wanted to etch copper, brass, and nickel silver so I used [Edinburgh
  etch](http://www.nontoxicprint.com/etchcopperandbrass.htm) which I made from ferric chloride I got
  at [Armstrong Tool  Supply](https://armstrongtoolsupply.com/), water, and citric acid I got at
  Meijer.
* You take out the metal and neutralize the etchant. For Edinburg etch I used sodium carbonate I got
  at Meijer.
* You remove the resist. For all the resists I listed except tape, they come off with acetone.

As far as what metal to etch, I found tons of cool options advertised as stamping blanks. There are
tons of them on Amazon prime, and a few in the jewelry section of craft stores, although you need to
be really careful to understand what type of metal they are. For example, putting aluminum in ferric
chloride will cause a dangerous chemical reaction.

Before getting into photos, I started with some simple designs I made on the computer. A keychain
for my sister’s cat sitter, and some Harry Potter bookmarks. Here is an example printed out on the
pnp paper:

{{< responsive-figure src="images/press-n-peel-printed.jpg" caption="A simple design printed onto press n peel paper. The design is mirrored because the paper is applied face down to the metal, and the resist transfers upside down." >}}

I found it pretty difficult to transfer them from the paper to the metal; I have a heat press and
that worked pretty well, but there were still holes where the ink didn’t transfer. The instructions
recommend heat between 275 and 325 degrees; I did a test at each temperature to find the one that
worked best for me (about 300 degrees, on the left):

The good thing is that the fine details mostly come through, and most of the gaps are in big dark
areas, which means that I can just color them in with a sharpie, which is what I did. Then I put
them in a bath of etchant, waited, neutralized, and took off the resist with acetone.

Definitely etched my designs into metal! Cool! But I noticed two things:

* The scuffs that come from holes in the resist can look cool on more distressed type designs, but
  they look really bad on clean designs like the cat pawprint keychain.
* The etched in designs can be really hard to see.

Luckily, while I had been shopping around at Armstrong Tool  Supply, I saw some [JAX
blackeners](https://jaxchemical.com/shop/) and thought they looked interesting. I experimented with
applying them while the resist was still on, which gives a pretty deep contrast (jax black on the
left two, jax brown on the right two):

{{< responsive-figure src="images/harry-styles-marvel-etched-brass-keychains-patina.jpg" caption="Brass keychains etched, with patina applied before removing resist from pnp paper." >}}

I also tried applying the patina to the whole thing and then polishing it off the top layer. I found
this [Vintaj buff block](https://www.amazon.com/Vintaj-Relief-Filing-Buffing-Sanding/dp/B004VYYF2U)
worked well for that, and it created a softer look, but still with more contrast:
