After coming back from a trip to Florida, the kids were excited about the
astonaut and knight costumes they saw at Disney and NASA. I pointed Doug to
some online tutorials for craft foam helmets. He got really excited about the
idea and put some together. They came out great!

Now that Doug had the basic idea from the tutorials, he kept going...

And going!

I didn't have a chance to help out with the knight costume! But Cole decided
he wanted to be a dragon to match, so I took him to the store to pick out a
fabric for the body of the costume.

I modified a footie pajama pattern to sew the body of the costume while Doug
crafted the dragon mask out of foam.

The wings were the hardest part. We agreed they could fit on the body like a
backpack in order to make the whole thing easy to get on and off. Doug did
an amazing job crafting them from foam and the fabric we picked for the body.

Finally, Doug made dragon claws out of craft foam and glued them to gloves.

At the end, we had one happy dragon!
