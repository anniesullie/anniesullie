One thing I'd been really excited to try on my Glowforge was etching metal. Of course the Glowforge
doesn't etch metal directly, but there are a lot of posts on the Glowforge forums where people had
spray painted metal and then etched it. I was really curious if it was easier to do than the laser
transferred resists I'd been using. So I searched the forums for all the information I could find on
methods people were using, and gave it a shot.

1. I started by using a matte black spray paint to spray paint some flat pieces of copper and brass.
   I let it dry for 24 hours.

2. I found settings by etching and scoring a test piece. The settings that worked best for me were:
   * Engrave: 2 passes, 1000 speed 20 power
   * Score: 2 passes, 500 speed 15 power

3. As I'd seen on the forums, after engraving there was a thin residue of paint left over. I started
   rubbing a spot in the middle with fine synthetic steel wool; you can see a shiny spot where I
   removed the residue.

   I kept going until I had gotten all the residue. I wasn't able to preserve all the fine details
   while polishing, but I did remove the pixellation in the etch:

4. Since I had spray painted both sides of the copper and brass pieces, I didn't need to add any
   additional resist. I put them into some [Edinburgh
   Etch](http://www.nontoxicprint.com/etchcopperandbrass.htm) for a few hours.

5. After removing from the etch, I used acetone to remove the spray paint. At this point I saw that
   the photo etch looked really cool from some angles, but really incomprehensible from others.

           caption="After etching and removing spraypaint, the way the light hits the etch on the top looks great, but the way the light hits the etch on the bottom it's too hard to see what the picture is." >}}

6. I realized I could put a patina on the metal before removing the spraypaint, and it would only
   darken the etched area. I did this with [JAX Brown](https://jaxchemical.com/shop/jax-brown/).

7. After drying the patina and using acetone to remove the paint, I finished with clear Krylon
   spray.
