  "title": "Halloween 2014: Monsters Inc Sully and Mike Wazowski!"
}

This is our first Halloween with two kids and I was excited to work on costumes for both of them.
Logan loved watching Monsters Inc so I decided to do Sully and Mike Wazowski costumes.

I started work on Logan’s Sully costume first. After much Googling, I decided to buy a vintage
[McCall’s 6628 pattern](https://sewing.patternreview.com/Patterns/55123) online, and I bought
turquoise fur fabric at fabric.com. After those arrived, there was a lot of cutting and sewing to
do! I spent several hours just cutting out the pieces.

With a lot of work, I got the costume body sewed together. Here’s Logan trying it on:

The pattern included boots, which were surprisingly easy to put together. I used dark grey felt for
the claws.

The pattern also came with a hood. I sewed it together, and Doug altered it a bit by adding ping
pong ball eyes and a play dough nose:

I really wanted the costume to have purple spots! After researching a bit, I followed some cosplay
forum advice and watered down purple fabric paint and dabbed it on:

I was worried the fur on the costume would look wet and matted, but after it dried and I did a light
brushing, we ended up with subtle purple spots:

The Mike Wazowski costume for Cole needed more creativity–he’s still a baby, and there’s a lot of
walking to be done on Halloween. So I decided to make a costume that could go in and out of the baby
carrier. I started, again, with the same [Running With Scissors
pattern](http://projectsbyjess.blogspot.com/2007/01/woodland-animal-costume-sewing-pattern.html) I
used for Logan’s Curious George and Max costumes. This time I made it in green fleece:

And threw together a matching hat with white horns:

I also modified the Sully costume pattern to make some green boots with white claws.

Now for the hard part: the baby carrier. I did a Google image search to get a simple drawing of
Mike’s face and printed out the mouth and eye, and used them as patterns to cut matching felt. Doug
drew the iris of the eye with two different colored green sharpies. Then I glued the felt together
and put it on some green fleece, and attached it to the baby carrier with safety pins. I put Cole in
the costume in the carrier, and I love the way it turned out!
