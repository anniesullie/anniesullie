}

The [Ann Arbor Sewing Center](http://www.annarborsewing.com/) had some awesome Star Wars fabric, so
I picked some up. I had some extra minky fabric from Loganâ€™s Halloween Costume, and I thought it
would be fun to make some baby blankets. They were super easy to make, just put the right sides of
the fabric together, cut to the size you want, and sew, leaving an opening to pull the blanket right
side out again. Then sew up the opening, and if you want sew a decorative stitch around the edge.
