We did Easter eggs for the first time this year. Logan requested that they be “scary”. So Doug and I
shredded some crayons and we sprinkled them on the eggs while they were still hot after boiling. We
all had a great time, and they look pretty different! Definitely cover the table and floor before
trying this, though.
