I got the book [Cake
Pops](http://www.amazon.com/Cake-Pops-Tricks-Recipes-Irresistible/dp/0811876373) a while ago and
I’ve been dying to try it out! There are a lot of recipes for spring, so I made some to take to the
neighborhood Easter egg hunt. They were really easy to make and they taste great! I’m definitely
going to try this again.
