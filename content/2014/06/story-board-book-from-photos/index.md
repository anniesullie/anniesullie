}

I’ve made a couple of books through [Pint Size Productions](http://www.pintsizeproductions.com/) and
really liked them. When my two-year-old nephew came to visit, I wanted to take the photos from the
visit and make them into a board book so he and my two-year-old son could remember them better.

And then I had an idea–wouldn’t it be cool to use Photoshop filters to make the book look
hand-drawn? So I tried out a bunch of drawing and sketch plugins and settled on [Akvis
Sketch](http://akvis.com/en/sketch/index.php). (I also used [Topaz
ReMask](https://www.topazlabs.com/remask) to cut out some of the backgrounds.)

Here are some of the pages. I’m pretty happy with it!
