I really like the [Jax](https://jaxchemical.com/) patinas, but
[Vintaj](https://vintaj-retail.myshopify.com/collections/patina) offers some
that are more like paint for metal and I really wanted to try them out. I had
engraved a few extra brass business cards with pictures. One had the picture
darkened with Jax black patina, and the other one hadn't been finished at all,
which resulted in the etched area naturally taking on a patina over time.

I wondered if it's really just as simple as painting on some patina, letting it
dry, and using the Vintaj buffing block to remove the patina from the raised
areas. So I threw on a lot of patina:

After the patina dried, I tried to buff it off with the buffing block. I think
I used too thick a coat; I ended up having to use sandpaper to get it off the
unengraved parts. I'll definitely use thinner coats next time.

But the cards still came out pretty well! I polished them and finished with a
coat of the glaze.
