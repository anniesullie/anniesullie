}

This year, Logan loves his old costume and it still fit, but Cole is big enough to walk around! So I
updated his Mike Wazowski costume, again with a green fleece bodysuit based on the trusty old
[Running With Scissors
pattern](http://projectsbyjess.blogspot.com/2007/01/woodland-animal-costume-sewing-pattern.html),
and taking Mikeâ€™s face off our baby carrier and putting it on an over-the-shoulder sack fleece
cutout, which we stuffed with a pillow.
