  "title": "Mitten Christmas Tree Skirt Made with Silhouette Cameo"
}

I just got a [Silhouette Cameo](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop/cameo) and I am really
excited to use it! It can cut paper, cardstock, fabric, vinyl, stickers, and even temporary tattoos
into whatever shapes you can put into vector graphic format on your computer. After a few
experiments with cardstock, I wanted to make something real. I decided to start small, with a
Christmas tree skirt.

I had seen some photos of a tree skirt with mittens on it, and since we live in the mitten state now
I thought it would be fun do do something like that. I had some red fleece lying around for the
skirt material, and I wanted to try out the Silhouette heat transfer fabric. So I bought some white
and green flocked heat transfer, and searched for “mittens” in the Silhouette online store. I bought
a mitten graphic for 50 cents, stretched it to the 9″ height of the heat transfer, and printed out 3
in white and 3 in green.

Doug cut the fleece into a circle by anchoring a yardstick in the center and rotating it, marking
off every few inches. I used white thread and a cute stitch on my sewing machine to hem the edges,
and some leftover buttons from Logan’s Halloween costume to button the edges. Then Doug ironed on my
heat transfers, and we were all done in under an hour! I’m really excited to start some more
ambitious projects soon.
