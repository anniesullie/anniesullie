My grandmother taught me to knit when I was 8 or 9 years old, and I’ve been doing knitting projects
on and off ever since. I switch back and forth between making things from patterns and designing
them myself. I don’t really know what I’m doing; I make things up as I go and look up techniques in
my trusty copy of [Stitch ‘n
Bitch](https://www.amazon.com/Stitch-n-Bitch-Knitters-Handbook/dp/0761128182) if I get lost. Several
years ago, I made my husband Doug a sweater, but he doesn’t wear it much because it needs to be
hand-washed. Two years ago, I decided to try again. I asked him if there was anything he could think
of that I could knit him that he would actually wear. I was thinking maybe gloves or a hat, but he
had something else in mind. The only thing he wanted, he said, was a hand-knit sweater that looks
just like a Red Wings hockey jersey. I made him one, but it took me a long time! Here is the story
(and the pattern).

I actually had to do two complete sweaters before I got it right. I had never knit something so big
before, and I made some critical mistakes in my first design. First, I used big needles to make the
knitting go faster. Second, I made the sweater as simple as possible by making the sleeves and the
front/back just square pieces that I sewed together. I knit all the pieces and sewed them together
and the sweater looked great! But then Doug tried it on and the combination of big stitches and
heavy sleeves attached at the sides of the body made the collar stretch and the sleeves hang down
past his knees! So we tried again with a revised design. Here’s the details of what we came up with:

# The Yarn
Doug insisted that the color had to be the same bright red the Red Wings wear, none of the nice
darker reds they sell in yarn stores. After a long search, we settled on geranium red [Bamboo
Ewe](http://www.redheart.com/yarn/bamboo-ewe). But there was a problem–there isn’t a white Bamboo
Ewe yarn. Or a white bamboo/wool blend. So we went with an acrylic that’s easy to find–“snow” white[Bernat Satin](http://www.yarnspirations.com/bernat-satin-yarn/164104.html). I was worried using two
different types of yarn would make the design look a little weird, but it came out fine.

# The Pattern
Doug laid out his official Red Wings jersey on the floor and measured it, and then drew out a
pattern for me in Sketchup:

After the stretching problems I had with size 10 needles, I switched to size 4 needles and knit a
few gauges. 4.5 stitches per inch wide and 6 stitches per inch high. To prevent the sleeves from
sagging, I switched to raglan sleeves. Then I just had to convert Doug’s measurements to my gauge. I
drew a couple of diagrams:

And from there I came up with patterns for the front, back, and sleeves:

# Back
Cast on 126 stitches white<br/>
18 rows garter stitch<br/>
Switch to red<br/>
80 rows stockinette stitch<br/>
Rows 81-160: decrease 1 each side on each knit row, to 46 stitches<br/>
2 rows stockinette stitch<br/>
Collar shaping:<br/>
Knit stitch, bind off 34, knit 6<br/>
Knit 5 rows stockinette stitch<br/>
Bind off

# Front
Cast on 126 sts white<br/>
18 rows garter stitch<br/>
Switch to red<br/>
80 rows stockinette stitch, starting pattern on 65th row<br/>
Rows 81-160: decrease 1 each side on each knit row<br/>
Collar shaping:<br/>
Row 129: split at middle onto two needles<br/>
Rows 129-145: decrease 1 each row each side of collar<br/>
Knit 5 rows stockinette stitch<br/>
Bind off

# Sleeves
Cast on 54 stitches<br/>
First 6 rows: knit 2 purl 2 ribbing<br/>
Next 12 rows: garter stitch<br/>
Over next 44 rows, increase to 120 stitches (I lost the notes of exactly how I did this)<br/>
Switch to white<br/>
12 rows garter stitch<br/>
Switch to red<br/>
48 rows garter stitch<br/>
Over next 56 rows, decrease to 12 stitches (Again, lost the notes)<br/>
Bind off

Block and sew back, front, and sleeves

# Collar
Pick up 90 rows around collar with circular needles, starting at front center<br/>
Knit 6 rows stockinette stitch, switching direction at end of each row<br/>
Bind off<br/>
Sew front center opening (makes more of a v-neck look)

# The Red Wings Logo
Doug took my gauge and a photo of the red wings logo and drew a pattern in excel:

You can see I marked it off as I knitted.

# Blocking
I wasn’t sure what to do about blocking! There isn’t much info online about blocking bamboo/wool
blends, and most sources say you’re not supposed to block acrylic. But the sleeves were different
sizes, and there was a big line in the front where I had taken a 10-month break when Logan was born.
So after much Googling, I decided wash the pieces in the washing machine first, then use this method
where you pin the piece to a foam board covered in batting to dry.

# Sewing
After blocking the pieces, sewing them together was pretty straightforward. I looked up the right methods for sewing the tops of pieces, sides of pieces, and tops to sides in Stitch ‘n Bitch.
