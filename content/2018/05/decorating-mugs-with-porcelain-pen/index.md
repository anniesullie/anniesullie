Even after twenty years as a woman in tech, [this article](http://www.sachajudd.com/one-direction/)
about One Direction fans and especially the Larries brought a fresh perspective. I mentioned it to
my sister, and as usual, she was way ahead of me. She also loves coffee, so when I found out about
[porcelain pens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0793F295W/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage), I
thought it would be cool to try and make her a Larry Stylinson mug.

I did a Google image search for a good picture and decided to start with this one:

I used the same techniques I do to [prep photos for metal
etching](https://anniesullie.com/2017/12/etching-photos-on-metal/) and managed to simplify the photo
down to something that I could cut a vinyl stencil out of on my cricut maker. Then I very carefully
transferred the stencil to a mug. I colored it in with a black porcelain pen. Then I waited 24
hours, took the stencil off and baked the mug at 300 degrees per the pen instructions. I love the
way it came out! Iâ€™m definitely going to try this again.
