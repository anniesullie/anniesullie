We have been running out of glasses lately and I’ve been thinking about decorating my own. I’ve seen
some cool pictures of frosted glass online and wanted to try something like that myself. The first
thing I tried was etching cream, which is pretty cheap and easy to find, but I ran into some big
problems.

The etching cream leaked through my stencil and around the glass, and the spots it was supposed to
etch were blotchy and not deeply etched. Worse, the [material safety data
sheet](http://edhoy.com/wp-content/uploads/msds/5303_53003_53004_msds.pdf) for armour etch is the
stuff of nightmares, especially with kids in the house.

So I looked around online and saw that people were getting much nicer results with sandblasting. It
took a bit of research to dig into which sandblasting equipment people were using. Eventually I
ended up getting an [air eraser](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CJIHFI) and [aluminum
oxide](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CJOAZE). I dug around online for logos of my favorite
fictional taverns, and came up with a few designs myself. I made vinyl stencils out of them on my
cricut maker. I picked up both clear and colored glasses, and got to work. Overall, I was really
surprised how easy sandblasting glass is and how well it came out! Will definitely try this again.
I’m excited to try glass pie pans and Christmas ornaments.
