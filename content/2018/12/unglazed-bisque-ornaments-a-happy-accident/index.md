I was really excited about the results I got lasering on [porcelain
ornaments](https://community.glowforge.com/t/the-great-ornament-show-off-thread-2018/32268/26?u=annie.sullivan),
so I tried to order a bunch on Amazon Prime. But I didn’t pay close attention to the description and
accidentally bought these [unfinished bisque
ornaments](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076QF9C6X/) instead. I had been planning to send them
back, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what it might look like to try to do a 3d engrave on one.
So I picked a test ornament to sacrifice, and tried out a simple gradient with increasing power
settings. The gradient showed up pretty well!

I searched Google Images for bump maps, and tried engraving one of those with the best gradient
settings I found (full power, 500 speed). It looked kind of carved, just like I wanted!

So I decided to try a real photo. I started out like I usually do, cutting the subject of the photo
out of the background.

Then I played around with the Silver Efex Pro filter to convert to black and white with lots of
structure and contrast. I cut the photo into an ornament-friendly circle with the ellipse tool, and
added an outer glow to the layer.

Finally I used the ToonIt! filter to make the artwork look more like a line drawing. I chose the
“anacleto” style because it left a lot of white even in the dark areas of the photo.

Then I sent it to the Glowforge, and it came out great! Now off to make more!
