Logan absolutely fell in love with Captain America over the summer, so it was the clear choice for
his Halloween costume. I was really excited about this costume. From [cute toddler
costumes](http://www.christinetrevino.com/2013/10/22/captain-america-costume/) to [amazing cosplay
constructions](http://smpdesigns.com/how-it-was-made-captain-america-armor-variant/), there are tons
of great ideas and tutorials online.

Doug and I were both really interested in all the stuff we’ve seen online made out of EVA foam
coated in PlastiDip. The shield was the obvious place to try it out. We started with a foam floor
tile and this [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxUYDgdJgnM&vl=en). We didn’t
have moldable plastic, so we improvised handles with spare foam, and just painted the star on. Logan
loves the way it came out!

Now that we had some practice with EVA foam, we moved onto a more complex piece: the helmet. I found
a [helmet template and video tutorial on
Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/598788437/captain-america-helmet-pattern). We printed and cut
several versions out of paper to find a size that fit Logan. Here’s an example that was a little too
big:

When we got the right size, we cut out template in 5mm EVA foam and Doug superglued it together:

Then Doug sprayed a coat of PlastiDip and a coat of Navy. He finished it off with an A and wings cut from white vinyl:

There are tons of awesome pictures and videos online of really cool cosplay suits and gauntlets and
boots and belts. But Logan is only six, so we decided to keep the body of the costume simpler. I
took a lot of inspiration from this [toddler
tutorial](https://christinetrevino.com/wp-content/cache/page_enhanced/www.christinetrevino.com/2013/10/22/captain-america-costume/_index.html_gzip).
The navy collared fleece and matching cargo pants came from Sears. I sewed a red-and-white-striped
belt from athletic fabric I got at Jo Ann. To finish it off, I made [gloves](http://christinetrevino.com/2012/09/13/diy-dark-knight-super-hero-gloves/) and [boots](http://www.christinetrevino.com/2012/10/22/diy-super-hero-boots/) from brown fabric. Doug
cut a star from 3mm stick-on white craft foam, and we stuck it on. Here’s some photos of the
finished product. Logan loves it!
