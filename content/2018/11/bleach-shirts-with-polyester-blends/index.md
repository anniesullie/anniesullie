}

All the tutorials for making bleach shirts say to use 100% cotton. But I had some Old Navy 60%
cotton 40% polyester blend shirts sitting around, and the kids need some long sleeve shirts for
winter. They’ve been asking about deathly hallows shirts after seeing someone wearing one, so I
decided to give it a shot.

I made stencils using contact paper on the Cricut. One problem I’ve had is that it’s super easy to
make stencils with vinyl or contact paper, but then you can’t iron to lighten the bleach. We
recently got a heat gun, so I decided to try that out instead. The contact paper shrunk a little
bit, but didn’t melt or stick to the shirt. And the design got way lighter! Will definitely be
refining this in the future.
