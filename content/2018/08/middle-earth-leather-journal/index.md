}

I saw these beautiful [map journals](https://tactilecraftworks.com/collections/journals) and thought
it would be fun to make one with a fictional map. Doug’s birthday was coming up and he loves Lord of
the Rings, so I decided to try making a Field Notes cover that’s a map of middle earth. I started
with the template I used for the [Marauder’s Map Field Notes
Cover](https://anniesullie.com/2018/08/leather-field-notes-cover/). While I was making the [Calvin
and Hobbes journal](https://anniesullie.com/2018/08/calvin-hobbes-moleskine-cover/), I made some
other journal templates, including a [Field Notes cover with pen
loop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SW63SThnz7Pu37gLikLgg2XqJFAliIhm/view):

I found a map of Middle Earth, and modified this design so that there is one pocket, and the back
wraps around the front, with the outline of the map as the wrap-around. You can download it as an
[SVG here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uww8X3DkZP1nhXIYMoMqsvDGQp72md90/view).

Next I cleaned up the map images to only be a single color, since I haven’t done any experimenting
with variable-power or dithering settings on the glowforge with leather yet, and I thought it would
look crisp as a simple black engrave. I laid them out separately in the Glowforge app, although it
would be better to line them up in Illustrator and upload to the app together. Images can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15cGXm0JlwEn8bol2DjIXhdjQ_qmFiaRo/view) and
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_Kn4wGpVgwHPvASWfacjyLRgDSH1VEw/view) for download.

Finally, I arranged everything in the Glowforge app and sent it to the laser. I used 2-3oz veg tan
leather, masked with
[this](https://www.jpplus.com/glassguard-paper-mask-for-laser-engraving?selected=7562, with the
glowforge set to medium proofgrade settings.

After everything was cut, I needed to dye and finish and sew the leather. There’s a lot about doing
this online:

* Lined up the pieces and punched holes for the snap manually.
* [Dyed and finish the leather](https://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-dye-leather/). I used [tan
  Eco-Flow gel antique](https://www.tandyleather.com/en/product/eco-flo-gel-antique-8-fl-oz-236-ml).
* Put a snap on each side of the clasp using the holes I punched.
* [Saddle-stitched](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-saddle-stitch-leather/) the pieces
  together.
