I had a lot of fun making the [Marauder’s Map Fields Notes
Cover](https://anniesullie.com/2018/08/leather-field-notes-cover/), and I wanted to try something
just a little bit more complex. Plus I needed a cover for a bigger journal. So I decided to extend
the field notes cover in Illustrator to fit a 5″x8.25″ [Moleskine Cahier
Journal](https://us.moleskine.com/cahier-journal-black/p0411), and add a pen loop and snap.

Here’s a [link to my
design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GgnGa8SyzEQZ0xdb9honrZnztSIF7DEp/view?usp=sharing), in case
anyone wants to use it. It looks like this:

After finishing the design, I fired up the Glowforge. There were only a few steps from there to a
finished journal:

* [Mask the
  leather](https://www.jpplus.com/glassguard-paper-mask-for-laser-engraving?selected=7562). I find
  this helps keep the leather stable on the bed of the laser, in addition to preventing scorch
  marks.
* Cut out the design on the Glowforge, etching an image of Calvin  Hobbes on top.
* [Dye and finish the leather](https://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-dye-leather/).
* Put a [snap](https://www.tandyleather.com/en/product/easy-to-do-line-20-snaps-setter) on each side
  of the clasp.
* [Saddle-stitch](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-saddle-stitch-leather/) the pieces
  together.
* Sand down the edges a bit.
