I just got a [Glowforge](https://glowforge.com/) and I’m so excited! I haven’t had time to make much
yet, but it came with a sample of leather, and I thought it would be fun to do Harry Potter
bookmarks. So I found an image of the [Marauder’s
Map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1byUjPpBCy4HOcKTOXJVttHJ-E5jLX1cz/view?usp=sharing) online, and
quickly threw together the [“I solemnly
swear..”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FtiW0zPvmRnNlqlAwN44D_koQQ-pLVSu/view?usp=sharing) quote
with footprints in Illustrator. I saved them as .png images and uploaded into the Glowforge app. It
automatically set them to engrave. Then I drew outlines of the bookmarks in Illustrator, [saved as
svg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hasWGCKp1qeP6pbbclfSSExTJarZeHPE/view?usp=sharing), and
uploaded them into the glowforge app. They were automatically set to cut. The Glowforge has a
camera, so I put the leather in the bed and could move the bookmark images around until I was happy
with the cut location on the leather.

I also used some of the leather to make tassels. Here they are! For a first try, I’m really happy
with them. I’ll need to learn more about finishing leather though!
