I happened upon the [Harry P](http://www.dafont.com/harry-p.font) font and decided it would be fun
to make a quick shirt for Logan. I typed in some text and drew some footprints in Silhouette Studio,
and then printed onto [stencil
vinyl](http://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop/materials/fabric-ink/item-number/ink-stencil-3t) on my
cameo. I used a sponge to paint through the stencil, fading away the footprints.
