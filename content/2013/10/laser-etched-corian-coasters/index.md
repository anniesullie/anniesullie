At one point, we were considering remodeling our kitchen, and we got some [Corian
samples](http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/construction-materials/surface-design-materials/brands/corian-solid-surfaces/articles/order-a-sample.html).
We didn’t end up doing the remodel, but we left them sitting around the house to see how durable
they are. My brother-in-law had always thought they made cool coasters.

When I took the laser class at [Maker Works](http://maker-works.com/wordpress/), I noticed one of
the materials that can be etched is Corian. Since my brother-in-law loves superheroes, I thought
superhero coasters would be a cool Christmas present.

I ordered some 4″x4″ samples in a dark color. They had some info printed on them, but it came off
with rubbing alcohol.

I picked out a set of superheroes and used Google image search to find their logos. Then I used
[Vector Magic](http://vectormagic.com/home) to convert the logo images into 1- or 2-color vectors.
(Either black, or black and grey for the Avengers and Captain America logos). I sized the vectors in
illustrator to match the size of the coasters.

Then I sent the jobs to the laser. Its built-in dithering made the black into a pretty sharp white,
and the grey a light grey. They ended up with an almost 3D effect.

I uploaded the SVG files I used if anyone else wants to try this out:
