}

I got really excited after taking the laser class at [Maker
Works](http://maker-works.com/wordpress/) and decided to try a simple project to start. I didn’t
want to worry about dithering photos, so I ran a batch job on all our family photos, putting them
through [Vector Magic](http://vectormagic.com/home) to see which ones converted to single-color
vectors the best.

I picked a few of the best ones, added some text in illustrator, and made cut lines for ornaments.
Then I got some cherry wood at Woodcraft and sent my files to the laser. I like how they came out!
In the future, I’ll mask the wood to minimize scorch marks.
