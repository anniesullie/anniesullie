}

This Halloween, Logan was obsessed with Curious George. So it was easy to pick out a costume idea
for him. I picked up some brown fleece and sewed up the same [Running With Scissors
pattern](http://projectsbyjess.blogspot.com/2007/01/woodland-animal-costume-sewing-pattern.html) I
used last year. Here’s a pic of Logan trying it on (sorry for the blurriness, he’s pretty hard to
catch standing still!)

With the base costume done, I started work on the face. First I did a bunch of Google image searches
for good drawings of George’s face. Then I got some light beige fleece, printed an outline of
George’s face and used it as a pattern to cut the face out of fleece. Then I traced George’s facial
features into an SVG file, cut them out on black heat transfer vinyl on my Silhouette machine, and
ironed it onto the beige fleece. Finally, I printed out an outline of George’s head, used it as a
pattern to cut some brown fleece, and sewed the whole face onto that.

I also bought a red t-shirt big enough to fit over the costume. Here’s a pic of Logan trying the
whole setup on so far:

The face worked out how I had hoped, so I sewed it on. But the shirt was way too long, so I cut and
hemmed it. After getting it down to the right size, I cut “Curious George” out of yellow heat
transfer vinyl on my Silhouette machine, and ironed it onto the shirt. Here’s the result:

Logan loved the costume! Here’s some pics of him enjoying it:
