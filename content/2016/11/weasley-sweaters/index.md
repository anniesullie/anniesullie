Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of knitting lately, and also a lot of reading Harry Potter to the boys. Logan
especially loves it. I finally learned to knit a [bottom up
sweater](https://blog.tincanknits.com/2017/03/28/lets-knit-a-bottom-up-sweater/), and got some
beautiful chunky yarn at [Spun](http://www.spunannarbor.com/), so knitting the boys Weasley sweaters
felt like the perfect winter project. I had a lot of fun with it, and will definitely be doing more
bottom up sweaters in the future!
